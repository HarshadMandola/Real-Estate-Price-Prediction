# Real Estate Price Prediction

A machine learning-based project that predicts **real estate property prices** based on various features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. This helps buyers, sellers, and agents estimate property values accurately.

## Features

- Predicts property prices using machine learning.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering (handling missing data, outliers, etc.).
- Model trained on historical housing datasets.
- Interactive web interface (Flask/Django) to input property details and view predictions.
- Visualization of pricing trends by area and features.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python    
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## How It Works

1. The dataset (historical housing prices) is cleaned and preprocessed.
2. Features like location, BHK, area, etc., are encoded and scaled.
3. A regression model (Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) is trained.
4. The web app allows users to input property details and get a predicted price.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshadMandola/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
